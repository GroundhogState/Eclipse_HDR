New crack at this project! Hope to sort out a few things. Maybe get it closer to finished, lol.

Now featuring a brand new Log!

Ah, the fun part: Trying to get across all the stuff I wrote before. Various versions in jupyter notebooks... Which worked OK, but I do find Jupyter quite annoying with its functional side-effects and the need to restart the kernel to re-import stuff (which I opted for to save notebook bloat, but could also reintroduce as cells to minimize).

Well. Let's see about making some more discrete investigations. For example, can we look at the blur scale, and see what happens if we deconvolve with that length scale? Do this by drawing lines across the lunar discretek edge and seeing what the transition length. Means finding centres and stuff too. Regarding registration, I would like to save & export the calculated centers. Could probably write some tests for all this stuff too. 

Ungh, alternatively,
